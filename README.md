# Simple-ML-Zoo-Classification

## Description
This project implements a simple machine learning task using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify animals from a zoo dataset. Written in C, the program parses the given dataset, makes predictions based on a new test dataset, and evaluates the accuracy of the predictions.

### Features:
- **Data Parsing**: Reads the animal data from the provided files and stores it in structs.
- **KNN Algorithm**: Uses k-nearest neighbors to classify animals based on their features.
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Measures the accuracy of the classification by comparing predicted and actual class labels.
- **Simple Interface**: Designed to run as a command-line program with no external dependencies.

### Technologies:
- **C Programming Language**
- **k-nearest neighbors (KNN) Machine Learning Algorithm**

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a C compiler.
3. Run `make` to compile the program.
